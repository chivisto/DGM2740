                    <p>Pan dulce (English: sweet bread) is the name for a variety of Mexican pastries. The creation of sweet bread was influenced by the French and Spaniards, who introduced 
                        baked goods such as crispy rolls, baguettes, and sweet pastries to Mexico. This inspired the indigenous peoples to create different types of panes dulces such as besos, 
                        conchas, and cuernos, among others. The bread is considered to be one of Mexico's most inexpensive treats and is consumed daily as breakfast or late supper, known as merienda.

                        Rosca de reyes ('kings' crown') is a treat in addition to a gift that is given on Three Kings Day, Dia de los Reyes Magos, which is held twelve days after Christmas, the celebration date of 
                        the birth of Jesus Christ. This bread is symbolic in many ways, the most illustrative being its round shape which signifies the crown of the Reyes Magos; see Biblical Magi. Baked inside is a 
                        small white plastic or ceramic figurine which represents the baby Jesus. The hidden baby Jesus symbolizes the secrecy of the location of Jesus as a child. The ruler of Jerusalem, King Herod, 
                        upon learning about the birth of the rightful King of Jerusalem, ordered that all male infants be killed so that he could keep his crown. Whoever finds the small figurine is obligated to host a 
                        party for the celebration of the Dia de la Candelaria - Fiesta de la Candelaria - which occurs on February 2

                        In Mexico, pan dulce is typically consumed at breakfast or evening supper. It is usually accompanied by hot chocolate, milk (or warm milk), or coffee, and is dipped into the drink for better taste. 
                        It can also be eaten alone. Pan dulce has been an important part of Mexican cuisine since the colonial years when the Spaniards introduced wheat and the French brought crispy baguettes and rich pastries. 
                        Traditional local dishes were soon replaced with European cuisine. In addition to its sweet taste, pan dulce is also inexpensive, an incentive for daily consumption.
